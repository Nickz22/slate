    <description>Calculates the credit card processing fee as 4.5% of the remaining balance on an opportunity.
The formula subtracts the Total Amount Paid (breadwinner_qbo__Total_Amount_Paid__c) from the total amount plus tax (Amount + Tax_to_collect__c), then applies a 4.5% fee to the remaining balance.

This ensures that the processing fee reflects only the unpaid portion of the total amount.</description>
