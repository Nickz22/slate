    <description>The Opportunity Close Date aligns with the Matching Principle for accounting. It represents the date revenue is earned:

Productions → Matches the Confirmed Shoot Date (Start).
Retouching → Matches the Initial Inquiry Date but shifts to today’s date when the stage is set to &apos;Won - Production - Complete&apos; (since billing occurs upon completion).
If no Confirmed Shoot Date is available, Lead Producers should set the Close Date to the end of the month in which the Opportunity is expected. Once set, a Flow will sync the Close Date with the Confirmed Shoot Date (Start).</description>
