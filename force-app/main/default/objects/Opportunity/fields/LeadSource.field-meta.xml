    <description>This shows the Lead Source where the Opportunity was derived from and is important for Marketing Dashboard Components &amp; Reporting. It also showcases whether the Opportunity came from a Return Client or New Client as we closely measure Marketing based on % of New Client v. Return Clients to ensure our marketing pipeline is generating sufficient new business. Return Clients are generally a Client Retention Metric and have no factor into Marketing efforts.</description>
